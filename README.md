## System requirements and code license

This software package contains examplary data, pre-computed MISCAT tests and
analysis scripts in Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
It has been successfully tested with Matlab R2020b.

The source code of the software is licensed under the MIT license (see file LICENSE).

The data is provided for academic and visualization purposes only.

Major authors of the code are Frank Werner and Jan Keller-Findeisen

## Setup

No specific installation is necessary. Execute "initialize.m" at least
once before running other scripts to include all paths.

## Examples

Make sure to run initialize.m at least once. 

Call examples/example_xxx.m to see the software estimating a hybrid segmentation,
  and confidence intervalls on the number of markers in each segment for experimental
  or simulated photon antibunching microscopy data.

## Usage

Make sure to run initialize.m at least once.
